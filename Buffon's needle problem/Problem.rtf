Buffon's needle problem is a classic question, see for details in Wikipedia or in WolframMathWorld. We will generalize this question. Take a sufficiently large sheet of paper that has parallel lines with unit distances from each other. Drop a needle of length L randomly onto the paper. Let X be the number of lines touched by the needle. Plot the experimental cumulative distribution function of X based on N experiments!

The command line input of the program is a positive integer number and a positive real number .

The output shall be a graph of the experimental cumulative distribution function with the interval [0,⌊L⌋+1] as the domain.

The program should be run from terminal with the values of N and L passed as a command prompt arguments. For example for the work of Adrian Smith with N=100 and L=2.5 the command is
  python3 3BAdrianSmith.py 100 2.5
